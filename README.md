# Tinymix-Manager-Apk-Mod
This is moded by me of the original app Tinymix manager: https://github.com/Dinodva/Tinymix-Manager-Apk with adding more permissions. If by chance, you have tinymix binaries as already preinstaled then you can use this app out of box, otherwise, to make it work, you have to instal via Magisk tinymix binaries: https://github.com/Dinodva/Tinymix-Binary-Installer-Magisk-Module 
I have to place apk file into zip because Github don't allow publishing of apks directly.
