# Tinymix-Manager-Apk-Mod

This is modified by me the original app [Tinymix Manager:](https://github.com/Dinodva/Tinymix-Manager-Apk) with more permissions added. If by chance, you have tinymix binaries as already preinstalled then you can use this app out of box, otherwise, to make it work, you have to install via [Magisk Module Tinymix Binaries:](https://github.com/Dinodva/Tinymix-Binary-Installer-Magisk-Module)   I have to place apk file into zip because Github don't allow publishing of apks directly.
